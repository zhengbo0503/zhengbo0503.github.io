#+TITLE: What's new in MATLAB R2024a

In this post, 
I will present several updates which has been made in MATLAB R2024b. 
For a detailed list of changes in MATLAB, 
please refer to [[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes.html][this page]].

** Open documentation in system browser
The =doc= function, which displays the documentation, 
will now show the documentation in the *system web browser*
instead of the help browser.
The help browser will be removed. 

** Determine approximate equality
One can now use =isapprox(A,B)= to determine whether 
=A= and =B= are [[https://uk.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/isapprox.html#mw_da42028f-56e4-4967-811a-6642335af9fc_head][approximately equal]]. 
For example, =sin(3/4*pi)= and =1/sqrt(2)= are the same in theory.
However, due to rounding errors, 
the expression =sin(3/4*pi)==1/sqrt(2)= will return =0=. 
In contrast, =isapprox= will take the rounding errors 
in to account. 
=A= and =B= will be treated as "the same"
if the difference satisfies 
\begin{equation}
  |{A-B}| \le \max 
\left({\rm AbsTol}, 
{\rm RelTol} \times \max(|{A}|,|{B}|)
\right)
\end{equation}
where =AbsTol= and =RelTol= are set to =1e-15= if =A= and =B= are of type =double=,
and =5e-7= if =A= or =B= is of type =single=. 
As a result, the expression 
=isapprox(sin(3/4*pi),1/sqrt(2))= will return =1=. 

One can also specify =AbsTol= and =RelTol=. For example,
#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
>> isapprox(A,B,RelativeTolerance=1e-14,AbsoluteTolerance=1e-14)
#+END_SRC
will set =RelTol= and =AbsTol= both to =1e-14=. 
If only one of the tolerance is specified, 
then the other one will automatically set to zero. 

** Specify Tikhonov regularization factor
The function =lsqminnorm(A,B)= returns an array $X$ 
that solves the linear system $AX = B$ 
and minimize the values of $\|AX - B\|_2$.

One can now specify the Tikhonov regularization factor =alpha=
by =lsqminnorm(A,B,RegularizationFactor=alpha)=,
which will minimize the norm 
$\|AX-B\|_2^2 + {\tt alpha}^2 \|X\|_2^{2}$. 
This is useful when the coefficient matrix =A= is very ill-conditioned.

** Control the width of icons in legend

A new layout parameter =IconColumnWidth= has been added into MATLAB.
One can now control the width of the legend icon by 
assigning a positive number to =IconColumnWidth= in point units,
where 1 point is 1/72 inch. The following image shows 
the same legend but with different =IconColumnWidth= values.
